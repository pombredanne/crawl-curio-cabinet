        <h2>Parsing Links isn't always straightforward</h2>

        <h3><a href='base'>Base Tag</a></h3>
        <p>The &lt;base&gt; tag allows the page to specify another url to use
            as the base of relative urls on the page, rather than the url of
            the page itself</p>

        <h3><a href='canonical'>Canonical Tag</a></h3>
        <p>The &lt;canonical&gt; tag specifies the canonical url for the
            page that's been visited</p>

        <h3><a href='schemes'>Schemes</a></h3>
        <p>The schemes of links aren't limited to just http, https, etc. --
            they can be things like 'mailto', 'tel', etc.</p>

        <h3><a href='data-uri'>Data URI</a></h3>
        <p>You can actually encode data (like images) into so-called data URI's
            and they can be quite large in practice.</p>

        <h3><a href='bad-uri'>Bad URI</a></h3>
        <p>We've sometimes found URIs that are kind of problematic. These
            examples come from the wild</p>
